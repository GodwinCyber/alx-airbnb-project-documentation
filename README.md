# Overview
The Airbnb Clone is a backend application designed to mimic the core functionality of Airbnb. It will provide a RESTful API (or GraphQL) that handles user accounts, property listings, booking reservations, and payment processing. This documentation phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the system, covering everything from high-level feature lists to low-level API specifications before a single line of code is written.

__Learning Objectives__
By completing this documentation project, you will learn how to:
- Translate project requirements into a structured list of features and functionalities.
- Model system interactions visually using Use Case Diagrams to identify actors and their goals.
- Articulate user needs by writing clear User Stories that guide development from a user-centric perspective.
- Map data movement through the system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to understand how information is processed.
- Detail specific processes with Flowcharts to define logical sequences and decision points.
- Write precise technical specifications that define API endpoints, data validation, and system behavior for developers.
- Utilize diagramming tools like Draw.io to create professional and clear technical diagrams.

__Key Concepts__
- Backend Architecture: The structure of the server-side application, including routers, controllers, models, and services.
- RESTful API Design: Creating endpoints that adhere to REST principles using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
- Data Modeling: Designing the database schema (e.g., using SQL like PostgreSQL or NoSQL) to efficiently store and relate data (Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.).
- Authentication & Authorization: Implementing mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity (AuthN) and control access to resources (AuthZ).
- Payment Gateway Integration: Securely processing payments using third-party services like Stripe or PayPal.
- Documentation: The practice of creating clear, maintainable, and comprehensive guides and specifications for a software project.

__Tools and Libraries__
- Draw.io / Diagrams.net: A free, online diagramming tool for creating Use Case Diagrams, DFDs, and Flowcharts.
- Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting the documentation repository.
- Markdown: A lightweight markup language for formatting the README.md and other documentation files.
- Node.js & Express.js (Potential): Likely JavaScript runtime and web framework for building the backend.
- Database (Potential): PostgreSQL ( relational) or MongoDB (non-relational).
- Authentication (Potential): bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWTs.
- Payments (Potential): Stripe API SDK.

__Real-World Use Case__
This documentation directly simulates the initial phases of a real-world software development lifecycle (SDLC) at any tech company. Before engineers start coding, Product Managers, System Analysts, and Technical Leads collaborate to produce exactly these kinds of artifacts:

- Product Requirements Doc (PRD): The list of features (Task 0).
- System Design Mockups: Use Case and Data Flow diagrams (Tasks 1 & 3).
- Agile/Scrum Backlog Items: User Stories (Task 2).
- Technical Specifications: Detailed API and requirement docs (Task 5). This process ensures everyone is aligned, reduces development errors, and provides a clear roadmap for the engineering team.
